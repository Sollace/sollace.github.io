				<p>It seems you found my website. Congrats! I knew you could do it!</p>
				<p>Now for your reward, I have hidden a key somewhere inside your r--</p>
				<p>What's that? Someone already did that? Saw?</p>
				<p>
					Okay, so my PR team said I can't do that. Something about human decency and copyright law,
					so, um... Here's a list of my socials and projects I work on. Enjoy!

					<a href="https://projectvinyl.net/">Project Vinyl</a>
				</h2>
				<img class="right" src="images/pv.png" alt="ProjectVinyl Logo"></img>
				A music and video archive for the fandom! ProjectVinyl is sponsored by
					<a href="https://theponyarchive.com">The Pony Archive</a>
				and was envisioned as a pony-centric alternative to youtube.

					<a href="https://minelittlepony-mod.com/">Mine Little Pony</a>
				</h2>
				<p>
				<img class="right" src="images/minelp.png" alt="Mine Little Pony Logo"></img>
				Originally created by Verdana, Mine Little Pony is an OG minecraft mod with the aim
				of bringing magic and friendship to the world of minecraft! It turns the player and most
				mobs into ponies, and features a custom skin server (using HD Skins) for players to upload
				their skins to.
				</p>
				<p>
				After Verdana's retirement, I eventually adopted the project and continue to support it to this day,
				addition new features and bug fixes for the latest version of Minecraft.

					<a href="https://sta.sh/01pfv954kl8r">Unicopia</a>
				</h2>
				<p>
				My own creation, this mod aims to bring further pony capabilities to minecraft!
				</p>
				<p>
				What started as a humble teleporting mod for me to play as a unicorn has gradually evolved into
				a complete gameplay experience, with unique abilities and items for each race, new types of blocks,
				foods, farming, and an in-depth megic and spell system.

				</h2>
				<p>
				<img class="right" src="images/pf.png" alt="Presence Footsteps Logo"></img>
				Another OG mod, this time by Huricaaaane (or simply Ha3). Presence Footsteps enhances
				the gameplay experience by adding unique and distinct sounds for a lot of minecraft's
				blocks. It's fully configurable and moddable.
				</p>
				<p>
				Same as what happened to Mine Little Pony, I picked up support of this mod after Ha3's retirement.

				</h2>
				<p>
				Do you read or write fanfiction? Do you use Fimfiction? Ever wish Fimfiction was <i>better</i>?
				</p>
				<p>
				Well this script might just be for you! Fimfiction Advanced adds several enhancements to fimfiction
				that I saw it needed, as well as brings back several OG features that knighty
				has slowly removed over the years. It really does feel like an entirely new site when you install this.
